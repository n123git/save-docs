# Yo-kai Save Editor API Documentation

A (hopefully) complete JS API for interacting with my save editor's Yo-kai branch

* How do you use the API?
* Follow this doc (XD), and paste the code into the JS console once your save file is loaded :>

## Quick Start

```javascript
console.log('=== Yo-kai Save Editor API ===');
console.log('Usage examples:');
console.log('  let yokai = getAllYokai();                    // Get all Yokai');
console.log('  yokai[0].set("level", 99);                    // Set level to 99');
console.log('  yokai[5].set("IV_Spd", 15);                   // Set speed IV');
console.log('  yokai[0].getRaw("energy");                    // Get raw hex bytes');
console.log('  yokai[0].setRaw("energy", "20 00 64 00");     // Set raw hex bytes');
console.log('  yokai[0].setHelper.energy.HP.set(500);        // Set HP using helper');
console.log('  yokai[0].setHelper.loafAndAi.loaf.set(3);     // Set loaf attitude');
console.log('  yokai[0].setHelper.specialEquip.alliance.set("Fleshy"); // Set alliance');
console.log('  let saveHex = exportSave();                   // Export as hex');
console.log('  setCP932(true);                               // Enable CP932 encoding');
console.log('  console.log(isCP932());                       // Check encoding mode');
```

## Core Utilities

### Basic Yokai Management

- **`getAllYokai()`** - Returns an array of all Yokai in the current save file.
- **`exportSave()`** - Exports the current save data as a hex string cuz why not :>
- **`setCP932(enabled)`** - Enable/disable CP932 text encoding for Japanese characters. Enable this for full support in JP save files (optional).
- **`isCP932()`** - Check if CP932 encoding is currently enabled. Again, enable this for full support in JP save files (optional).
- **`currentSlot()`** - Returns the current Yokai slot selected in the editor UI, null if none is selected. (requires API v1.1).
- **`syncSave()`** - Syncs the API save with the UI save by replacing the UI save and reloading the UI. (requires API v1.1).

### Yokai Object Methods

Each Yokai object returned by `getAllYokai()` has the following methods:

#### Standard Setters/Getters
- **`.set(field, value)`** - Set a field's value. DO NOT use this for complex fields.
- **`.get(field)`** - Get a field's value. DO NOT use this for complex fields.
- **`.getRaw(field)`** - Get raw hex bytes for a field. The complex field helper can help you with this so you don't need this for complex fields either lol.
- **`.setRaw(field, hexString)`** - Set raw hex bytes in the form of a string for a field i.e. `"60 00 A9 81"`. The complex field helper can help you with this so you don't need this for complex fields either lol.

Notes:
- Fields are **case-sensitive**.
- You cannot edit hex fields via `.set` it will throw an error. Use `.setRaw` and `.getRaw` instead.

#### Helper Methods

The `.setHelper` object provides (hopefully) convenient methods for complex fields to reder `setRaw` and `getRaw` mostly obsolete. Read the property list for use instructions.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Yokai Editing
```javascript
// Get all Yokai
let allYokai = getAllYokai();

// Level up first Yokai to max
allYokai[0].set("level", 99);

// set some garbage IVs for no reason whatsoever
allYokai[0].set("IV_Spd", 15);
allYokai[0].set("IV_Str", 15);
allYokai[0].set("IV_Spr", 15);
allYokai[0].set("IV_Def", 15);
```

### Advanced Editing with Helpers
```javascript
// Create a perfect Yokai by overwriting the first one (ALWAYS Jibanyan in legit saves)
let perfectYokai = allYokai[0];

// Max stats
perfectYokai.setHelper.energy.HP.set(999);
perfectYokai.setHelper.energy.Soul.set(999);

// Max abilities
perfectYokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.attackLevel.set(10);
perfectYokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.techniqueLevel.set(10);
perfectYokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.soultimateLevel.set(10);

// Set attitudes
perfectYokai.setHelper.loafAndAi.loaf.set(0);
perfectYokai.setHelper.loafAndAi.ai.set(2);  
```

### Raw Hex Editing
```javascript
// For devs who want direct hex manipulation
let energyHex = allYokai[0].getRaw("energy");
console.log("Current energy hex:", energyHex);

// Set raw energy data
allYokai[0].setRaw("energy", "FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00");
```

### Property List & Editing Guide
This is a list on everything that *can* and *can't* be edited and how to do so.

num1:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("num1", "5")`
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
   - The complete purpose is unknown.

num2:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("num2", "7")`
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
   - The complete purpose is unknown.
  
youkaiId:
- Note: Also known as the yokai itself, type rares are considered seperate yokai. Also, beware of capitalization. Can be edited via the default set method: `yokai.set("youkaiId", ID)`.
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
 
nickname:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("nickname", "hi!")`
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`. Renders as a black-box in game for invalid values and `""` or `00` represents no nickname used.
   - Uses cp932 (an extension of SHIFT_JIS) in JP versions, and UTF-8 in international versions, although this is automatically handled.

unused1:
- Edited via the hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("unused1", "00")`. Also this currently has no known use.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
 
specialUnlock:
- Edited via the helpers OR hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("specialUnlock", "0A 00...")`. This holds attack, technique and soultimate levels.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
   - Edit via `yokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.attackLevel.set()`, `yokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.soultimateLevel.set()` and `yokai.setHelper.specialUnlock.techniqueLevel.set()` respectively (and their get methods).
   - The highest valid value is 10 (`0x0A`)

expPoint:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("expPoint", "32")`. Note: this represents the XP *TOWARDS* the next level, not the total XP :>
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
 
energy:
- Edited via the helpers OR hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("energy", "0A 00 01 0B")`. This holds the HP remaining and Soul guage.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
   - Edit via `yokai.setHelper.energy.HP.set()`, and `yokai.setHelper.energy.Soul.set(2)` along with their respective get methods. (Im too lazy to add them to this).
 
ownerId:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("ownerId", "87f16038")`.
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
 
IV_HP, IV_Str, IV_Spr, IV_Def, IV_Spd, EV_HP, EV_Str, EV_Spr, EV_Def, EV_Spd, SC_Str, SC_Spr, SC_Def, and SC_Spd:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("SC_Str", "-3")` or `yokai.set("IV_HP", 2)`. Note: SC stats are signed, others are **not**.
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
   - IVs can technically reach 127, but HP_IV's legal max is 80, and the other IVs cap out at 40. EVs cap out at 127. Legal SCs can't be smaller than -10 or larger than 25.

unknown:
- Edited via the hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("unknown", "a")`. Also this currently has no known use.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, but can be gotten as a string from `get()`.
 
level:
- Edited via the default set and get methods: `yokai.set("level", 21)`. Note: this can theoretically go up to 255, but the game automatically sets it to 99 if it's higher.
   - Can also be edited via `setRaw()`, and `getRaw()`.
   - Values > 99 automatically get set to 99 when the game is loaded.
 
special6:
- Edited via the helpers OR hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("special6", "0A 00 01 0B...")`. This holds pose data.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
   - Edit via `yokai.setHelper.special6.unlockedPoses.set()`, and `yokai.setHelper.special6.currentPose.set()` along with their respective get methods.

loafAndAi:
- Edited via the helpers OR hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("loafAndAi", "0A 00 01 0B...")`. This holds attitude data. Loaf is loafing attitude, AI is move attitude/frequency/moveAI
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
   - Edit via `yokai.setHelper.loafAndAi.ai.set()`, and `yokai.setHelper.loafAndAi.loaf.set()` along with their corresponding get methods.

specialEquip:
- Edited via the helpers OR hex set and get methods: `yokai.setRaw("specialEquip", "0A 00 01 0B...")`. This holds Jibanyan's soultimate and Alliance (also known as Bony/Fleshy) data. Jibanyan's Alliance (and perhaps other story-befriends, and wicked yokai) *CANNOT* be changed due to how the game handles this in save files.
   - Can NOT be edited via `set()`, and `get()`.
   - Edit via `yokai.setHelper.specialEquip.alliance.set()`, and `yokai.setHelper.specialEquip.equipment.set()` (I totally didn't call it equipment because im brain-dead and too lazy to change it) along with their corresponding get methods. Note: for `alliance.set` any value that isnt "Bony" (case-insensitive) is considered fleshy/wicked/other. JIBANYAN SOULTIMATE IS CURRENTLY BROKEN USE HEX EDITING VIA SET AND GETRAW


### Save Management
```javascript
// Enable Japanese text support
setCP932(true);

// Make edits...
allYokai[0].set("level", 99);

// Export modified save
let modifiedSave = exportSave();
console.log("Modified save hex:", modifiedSave);
```

## Notes

- This API currently has input validation lazier than me so don't put the wrong value :P
- Always call `getAllYokai()` first to load Yokai data
- USE THE HELPER METHODS FOR COMPLEX FIELDS, IF YOU USE THE HEX EDITOR WHY??????
- Raw hex editing requires understanding of the save file format, so AGAIN, USE THE HELPERS!!!!
- CP932 encoding is needed for proper Japanese character support, there is no way around this for now.
- Changes are applied immediately to the in-memory save data so yeah :<
- Use `exportSave()` to get the final modified save file

DEV NOTES:
FIX SOME ADVANCED FIELDS 95%
ADD REFRESH VIEW FOR USERS 0%
ADD WAYS TO EXPOSE LOADING SAVE FILES BEFORE INIT WITHOUT USING DOM SHENANIGANS 0%
ADD API SUPPORT FOR THE ITEMS EDITOR, GENERAL EDITOR ETC 50%
